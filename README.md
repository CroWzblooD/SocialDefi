# AI Influencer Agents for Blockchain Communities

## Problem Statement
The rapid expansion of blockchain technologies and decentralized platforms has created a need for real-time, accessible, and engaging community experiences. Users often struggle to keep up with blockchain news, token prices, community updates, and technical insights. This gap can hinder community engagement, reduce participation, and lead to misinformation. Additionally, navigating the fast-paced environment of blockchain communities across platforms like Telegram or X (formerly Twitter) often feels fragmented and overwhelming.

## Objective
Our project aims to enhance the social experience within blockchain communities by developing **AI-powered influencer-like agents**. These agents will provide real-time insights, answer community questions, engage users interactively, and serve as alpha callers for key updates. To prototype and execute this vision, we will build a **Telegram chatbot** with the following features:

- **Quizzes and Interactive Engagements**: A gamified quiz module to educate users about blockchain concepts, updates, and trends.
- **News and Updates**: Real-time notifications for blockchain news and updates tailored to the community's interests.
- **Token Price Tracking**: A feature to display the current price of tokens and provide historical data or trends.
- **Stats and Analytics**: Insights and data visualizations derived from blockchain analytics, offering actionable information to users.
- **Community Notifications**: Alerts and reminders about events, community milestones, or announcements.

## Environment Setup
To run this project locally, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```plaintext
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
MODE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.mode.network
MODE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x70B1053B873028ed1Bd3411A4e0d43ED6E276B78
```

### Required Packages
Install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot==20.7 python-dotenv==1.0.0 web3==6.11.3 google-generativeai==0.3.1 aiohttp==3.9.1
```

## Code Overview
The main bot functionality is implemented in Python using the `python-telegram-bot` library. Below is a simplified version of the bot's main structure:

```python
import os
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import Application

class ModeBot:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization code here

    def run(self):
        app = Application.builder().token(os.getenv('TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN')).build()
        # Add handlers here
        app.run_polling()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot = ModeBot()
    bot.run()
```

This project is poised to bridge the gap between blockchain data and user engagement, creating a thriving community through advanced AI-powered influencer agents.
